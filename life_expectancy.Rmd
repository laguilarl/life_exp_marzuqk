# Abstract

Here we examine a life expectancy plot

# Analysis

We will first clean the data

```{r}
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
gu <- gapminder_unfiltered
gu %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  filter(lifeExp == max(lifeExp)) %>%
  select(country, year, lifeExp) %>% 
  arrange(year) 
gu %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  filter(lifeExp == max(lifeExp)) %>%
  select(country, year, lifeExp) %>% 
  arrange(year) 
```

We will now recreate the plot from Oeppen and Vaupel (2002).
